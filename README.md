# Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Project Readme

## Introduction
This project uses a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to detect potential fraud in a dataset of credit card applications. The SOM is a neural network-based technique used for unsupervised learning, and in this case, it helps identify patterns and anomalies within the credit card application data.

## Getting Started
To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `minisom`. You can install these dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas minisom
   ```

3. Place your credit card application data in a CSV file named `Credit_Card_Applications.csv` in the project directory. Make sure the CSV file has the appropriate columns, with features in columns and the target variable in the last column.

4. Open the Python script containing the code provided in the project and execute it. You can use your favorite Python IDE or run it in a Jupyter Notebook.

5. The SOM will be trained on your dataset, and a visualization of the SOM will be generated to help identify potential frauds.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of the key parts of the code:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The project starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the credit card application data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Feature Scaling
- The features in the dataset are scaled using Min-Max scaling to ensure that all features have the same scale, which is essential for the SOM's training.

### Training the SOM
- The MiniSom library is used to create and train the Self-Organizing Map. The SOM's parameters, such as the grid dimensions, input length, sigma, and learning rate, are specified and initialized with random weights. The SOM is then trained using the data.

### Visualizing the SOM
- The code generates a visualization of the trained SOM to visualize how the data is clustered. This visualization can help identify areas of the map where frauds may be concentrated.

### Finding the Frauds
- The code identifies potential frauds by locating clusters on the SOM grid that contain suspicious data points. These clusters are concatenated and transformed back to the original feature space to obtain the details of potential fraud cases.

## Results
After running the code, you will have the potential fraud cases identified and displayed. You can further investigate these cases and take appropriate actions, such as flagging them for manual review or conducting a more in-depth analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Self-Organizing Maps for identifying potential fraud in credit card applications. By following the steps outlined in this readme and understanding the code, you can apply this technique to your own dataset and enhance fraud detection efforts.
